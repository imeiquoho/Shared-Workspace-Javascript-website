# 🏢 Shared Workspace Web App

A dynamic coworking space management platform that enables users to register as **Property Owners** or **Coworkers**, list properties and workspaces, search and filter available spaces, leave star-rated reviews, and manage listings — all through a responsive, user-friendly interface.

Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla), Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, this full-stack application provides both client and server functionality with local authentication and cloud database integration.
